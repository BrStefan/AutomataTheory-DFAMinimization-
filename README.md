# AutomataTheory-DFAMinimization-

This code reads an DFA, and checks if it's completely defined and the data entered it's correct. After that, it apply the Table Filling Method (Myhill-Nerode Theorem) to obtain the Minimized DFA. The output is formed by the pair of new states, the pair of states that are non-finals and finals, and the new transition function.
